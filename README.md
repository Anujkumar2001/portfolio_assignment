# Portfolio React Application

This project is a conversion of an HTML/CSS portfolio into a dynamic React application. The original code has been modularized into React components and enhanced with various libraries including modal, marquee, and smoothScroll for interactive elements. Axios is used to fetch data from APIs, supplemented with manually created arrays for components requiring additional data like blogs, rendered dynamically using map functions. Inline styles were employed to address CSS issues encountered during conversion.
